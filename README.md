# FastSpring Sessions Playground
The aim of this tool is to interactively teach some of the methods the FastSpring javascript library [Store Builder Library](https://fastspringexamples.com/store-builder-library-overview/) offers to modify the current cart session.

## Live Demo
You can access a live demo [here](https://fastspringexamples.github.io/fastspring-sessions-playground/).

What you see on the main page is a display of all the products available in the selected storefront. You can shop around and checkout when you are ready.

In the top left corner you can see a "burger" icon (â˜°). When you click on it, a left side menu opens with the operations you can perform over the session:

- **Add custom price**: allows you to override the default price of the chosen product.
- **Add customer information**: allows you to define information about the buyer prior to when the popup checkout displays.
- **Push secure payload**: you can input a whole custom session represented by a JSON object.
- **Change storefronts**: you can choose between the default available storefronts or add your own one.
